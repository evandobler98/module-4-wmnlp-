{"lyrics": "I see a red door and I want it painted black\r\nNo colors anymore I want them to turn black\r\nI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes\r\nI have to turn my head until my darkness goes\r\nI see a line of cars and they're all painted black\r\nWith flowers and my love both never to come back\n\nI see people turn their heads and quickly look away\n\nLike a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day\n\nI look inside myself and see my heart is black\n\nI see my red door and it has been painted black\n\nMaybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts\n\nIt's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black\n\nNo more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue\n\nI could not foresee this thing happening to you\n\nIf I look hard enough into the settin sun\n\nMy love will laugh with me before the mornin comes\n\nI see a red door and I want it painted black\n\nNo colors anymore I want them to turn black\n\nI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes\n\nI have to turn my head until my darkness goes\n\nHmm, hmm, hmm,...\n\nI wanna see it painted, painted black\n\nBlack as night, black as coal\n\nI wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky\n\nI wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black\n\nYeah!"}
