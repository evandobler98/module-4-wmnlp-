{"lyrics": "If I leave here tomorrow\r\nWould you still remember me?\r\nFor I must be traveling on now\r\n'Cause there's too many places I've got to see.\r\nBut if I stayed here with you, girl,\n\nThings just couldn't be the same.\n\n'Cause I'm as free as a bird now,\n\nAnd this bird you can not change, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\nAnd this bird you can not change.\n\nAnd this bird you can not change.\n\nLord knows I can't change.\n\n\n\nBye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah,\n\nThough this feeling I can't change.\n\nBut please don't take it so badly,\n\n'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame.\n\n\n\nBut if I stayed here with you, girl,\n\nThings just couldn't be the same.\n\n'Cause I'm as free as a bird now,\n\nAnd this bird you'll never change, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\nAnd this bird you cannot change.\n\nAnd this bird you cannot change.\n\nLord knows, I can't change.\n\nLord, help me, I can't change.\n\n\n\nLord, I can't change.\n\nWon't you fly high, free bird, yeah?"}
