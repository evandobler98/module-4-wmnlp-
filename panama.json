{"lyrics": "Jump back, what's that sound ? \nHere she comes, full blast and top down. \nHot shoe, burnin' down the avenue. \nModel citizen zero discipline \nDon't you know she's coming home with me? \nYou'l lose her in the turn. \n\nI'll get her! \n\nPanama, Panama \n\nPanama, Panama \n\nAin't nothin' like it, her shiny machine. \n\nGot the feel for the wheel, keep the moving parts clean. \n\nHot shoe, burnin' down the avenue, \n\nGot an on-ramp comin' through my bedroom. \n\nDon't you know she's coming home with me? \n\nYou'll lose her in the turn. \n\nI'll get her! \n\nPanama, panama\n\nPanama, panama\n\nYeah, we're runnin' a little bit hot tonight. \n\nI can barely see the road from the heat comin' off of it. \n\nAh, you reach down, between my legs, \n\nease the seat back. \n\nShe's blinding, I'm flying, \n\nRight behind the rear-view mirror now. \n\nGot the feeling, power steering, \n\nPistons popping, ain't no stopping now! \n\nPanama, Panama \n\nPanama, Panama"}
