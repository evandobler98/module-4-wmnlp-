{"lyrics": "Standing in the rain, with his head hung low\r\nCouldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show\r\nHeard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene\r\nPut his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream\r\nHe heard one guitar, just blew him away\n\nHe saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day\n\nBought a beat up six string in a secondhand store\n\nDidn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure\n\n\n\nThat one guitar, felt good in his hands\n\nDidn't take long, to understand\n\nJust one guitar, slung way down low\n\nWas one way ticket, only one way to go\n\n\n\nSo he started rockin'\n\nAin't never gonna stop\n\nGotta keep on rockin'\n\nSomeday he's gonna make it to the top\n\n\n\nAnd be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes\n\nHe's a juke box hero\n\nHe took one guitar, juke box hero, stars in his eyes\n\nJuke box hero, he'll come alive tonight\n\n\n\nIn a town without a name, in a heavy downpour\n\nThought he passed his own shadow, by the backstage door\n\nLike a trip through the past, to that day in the rain\n\nAnd that one guitar made his whole life change\n\n\n\nNow he needs to keep rockin'\n\nHe just can't stop\n\nGotta keep on rockin'\n\nThat boy has got to stay on top\n\n\n\nAnd be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes\n\nHe's a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes\n\nYeah, juke box hero, got stars in his eyes\n\nWith that one guitar he'll come alive\n\nCome alive tonight\n\n\n\nYeah, he's gotta keep rockin'\n\nHe just can't stop\n\nGotta keep on rockin'\n\nThat boy has got to stay on top\n\n\n\nAnd be a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes\n\nHe's a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes\n\nJust one guitar, put stars in his eyes\n\nHe's just a juke box hero, aah aah aah\n\nJuke box hero, juke box hero, he's got stars in his eyes\n\nStars in his eyes"}
